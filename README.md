**click** the game board

then use the **W** **A** **S** **D** keys to move the ball

an experiment with the [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) [renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building.html) from the game engine [Unity](http://unity3d.com/). a small iteration on this [Unity intro tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial)

this example runs on binary files compiled from a Unity project. you can view the source code for the Unity project at the [roll-a-ball-unity github repo](https://github.com/micahstubbs/roll-a-ball-unity)

#### future study

I'd like to re-implement this roll-a-ball game with other WebGL abstractions, like [Three.js](http://threejs.org/) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)
